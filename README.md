# kids-coding-challenges
Set of coding challenges with progressive difficulty, suitable for kids or beginners.

Each directory has one challenge. The challenges are ordered with relatively increasing difficulty. There are also test cases for each challenge to verify if the challenge is successfully completed or not. To run the unit test, first change to the right directory using the `cd` command.

```
cd <challenge_directory>
```

And then execute the following command to let python3 run the unit tests.

```
python3 -m unittest discover --verbose
```

Here is the list of challenges in the order of increasing difficulty.

* even_or_odd
* arithmetic
* leap_year
* prime
