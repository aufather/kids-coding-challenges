"""Implement the functions is_even and is_odd

An even number is one that is divisible by 2, i.e when dividing an
even number by 2, there is no remainder. And an odd number isn't
divisible by 2, i.e when divided by 2, there will be a remainder.

The operator % evaluates to the remainder of a division operation. For
example 15 % 10 will evaluate to 5.
